This is a word search kata solved in Python (3.6.2). Given a square grid of letters and a word, it finds and reports the position of the word in the grid as a sequence of coordinates.
At this point the kata supports searching for a word horizontally and vertically in either direction. Support for diagonal searching can be added very easily by creating new search strategies and plugging them in.
To run the tests from command line, make sure you have Python 3 in your path and then execute `python3 -m WordSearchTest`.
